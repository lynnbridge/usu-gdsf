  This is Team 2's CS 5890 project. This project is to help the display and allow consumers access to games built by students
  in the Game Development Class at Utah State University. It is a collaboration of many different students with various tasks 
  both on the front and back end. The project is built using Vue and Go lead by Gordon Fjeldsted and Bridget Staley.
